# Godot 4 CRT Screen Effect
An example of how to implement a Godot 4 CRT Screen Effect. There's a corresponding video tutorial showing how I made this project: https://youtu.be/E401x98N6iA. I'd recommend watching it if you want to get a better understanding of how the effect works.

Heavily insprired by Acerola's video on Loop Hero's CRT effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWdySZ0BtJs
